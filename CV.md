Profile
-------

I am a genuine, positive and hardworking individual, who always strives to achieve the highest standard possible, at any given task. I am passionate about Economics, especially when I have the chance to combine all my knowledge in the field with research. I feel research really helps us understanding what the markets (and the world) need by looking at the past; which gives us the opportunity to make the world a better place.

I enjoy learning new things, I can work very well under pressure and I have a restless mind, characteristics which allow me to believe that I will be a successful Economics PhD student.
